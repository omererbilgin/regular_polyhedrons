# regular_polyhedrons
Implementation of drawing the regular polyhedrons by iterating over indices to connect vertices together.
Points can be visualised for each shape.
Rotation is possible for a better view.
Also, random rotator for [-30, 30]Degree interval with an adjustable refresh rate.

This is a BME homework and a good source code to understand how systems like CAD, Inventor work with rotation and drawing lines for 2D and 3D.
